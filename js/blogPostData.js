        <p class="open-post-p">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used 
            to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create 
            simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques 
            into existing projects.
        </p>
        <p class="open-post-p">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share 
            what I was learning and most things about my journey with the 
            world.
        </p>
        <h2 class="open-post-h2">How I got started</h2>
        <p class="open-post-p">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. 
            I would take notes about what I was learning. After each 
            learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect 
            on what I learned but also write short summaries of what 
            I learned using my own words.
